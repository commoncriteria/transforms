   <empty title='Security Requirements'>
     This chapter describes the security requirements  which have to be fulfilled by the product under evaluation.
     Those requirements comprise functional components from Part 2 and assurance components from Part 3 of <citeCC/>.
     The following notations are used:
     <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
       <li>
         <b>Refinement</b> operation (denoted by <b>bold text</b> or <strike>strikethrough
         text</strike>): is used to add details to a requirement (including replacing an assignment
         with a more restrictive selection) or to remove part of the requirement that is made irrelevant
         through the completion of another operation, and thus further restricts a requirement.
         </li>
       <li>
         <b>Selection</b> (denoted by <i>italicized text</i>): is used to select one or more options
         provided by the [CC] in stating a requirement.</li>
       <li>
         <b>Assignment</b> operation (denoted by <span class="assignable-content">italicized text</span>): is used to assign a
         specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Showing the
         value in square brackets indicates assignment.</li>
       <li>
         <b>Iteration</b> operation: is indicated by appending the SFR name with a slash and unique identifier
            suggesting the purpose of the operation, e.g. "/EXAMPLE1".
       </li>
     </ul>
   </empty>
